### Made this quiz on CJRM's course, it's simple but i've learn it a lot!!

#### Originally i wasn't thinking to publish this but now i know creating little things is the road to create bigger things ^^

Obs: the index.html template I used here was made by Roger(the teacher) but the "theme" of the quiz was my idea :P
Obs2: trying basic typescript in this project
